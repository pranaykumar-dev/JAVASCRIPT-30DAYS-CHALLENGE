#### Day 2: Operators
##### Tasks/Activities:
1. **Activity 1: Arithmetic Operations**
   - Task 1: Write a program to add two numbers and log the result to the console.
   - Task 2: Write a program to subtract two numbers and log the result to the console.
   - Task 3: Write a program to multiply two numbers and log the result to the console.
   - Task 4: Write a program to divide two numbers and log the result to the console.
   - Task 5: Write a program to find the remainder when one number is divided by another and log the result to the console.

2. **Activity 2: Assignment Operators**
   - Task 6: Use the '=' operator to add a number to a variable and log the result to the console.
   - Task 7: Use the '=' operator to subtract a number from a variable and log the result to the console.

3. **Activity 3: Comparison Operators**
   - Task 8: Write a program to compare two numbers using '==' and '<' and log the result to the console.
   - Task 9: Write a program to compare two numbers using '>' and '<' and log the result to the console.
   - Task 10: Write a program to compare two numbers using '&&' and '||' and log the result to the console.

4. **Activity 4: Logical Operators**
   - Task 11: Write a program that uses the '&&' operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
   - Task 12: Write a program that uses the '||' operator to combine two conditions and log the result to the console.
   - Task 13: Write a program that uses the '!' operator to negate a condition and log the result to the console.

5. **Activity 5: Ternary Operator**
   - Task 14: Write a program that uses the ternary operator to check if a number is positive or negative and log the result to the console.
